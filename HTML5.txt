i. media : HTML5 brought lot of media accessibilityusing tags like 
   video,audio,iframe and picture

   video: videos can be inserted into HTML webpage using video element and its path can be accessed by source elements 'src' attribute

   <video height="200" controls  muted>
        <source src="path">
    </video>
   
   audio: audios can be inserted into HTML webpage using audio element and its path can be accessed by source elements 'src' attribute
  
   <audio height="200" controls  muted>
        <source src="path">
    </audio>
  'controls' allows control elements like play,pause etc..,
  'autoplay' allows media to play automatically when page loads
  'muted' allows media to play without audio

    Iframe : Iframe is a container that is used to display any embedded media with attributes like src
     <iframe src="path to embed media" height="200" frameborder="0"></iframe>

   Picture: Picture element is used to display responsive images

    --> Each source tag should have media defines width and it should be in decreasing order
    --> img tag should be at the end of picture element
     <picture>
        <source media="(min-width:1024px)" srcset="path">
        <source media="(min-width:576px)" srcset="path">
        <img src="path" alt="shinchan" height="200">
    </picture>

  Semantic Coding: HTML5 brought meaningful elements to make the code more understandble and better at SEO. These elements are called semantic elements.
  for eg:
     // HTML 4 code
     <div>
         <a>Home</a>
         <a>About</a>
         <a>Contact</a>
     </div>
     //HTML5 code
     <header>
         <a>Home</a>
         <a>About</a>
         <a>Contact</a>
     </header>

popular semantic elements are header , footer, section, article , main, aside, nav, figure 

<figure>
        <img src="./css-grid-poster.png" alt="grid post" height="200">
        <figcaption>GRID POSTER</figcaption>
    </figure>

All semantic elements are block except nav


3. canvas: canvas is a frame where javascript can draw 2d or 3d diagrams

4. svg (scalable vector graphics): svg is used to create nice drawings with different shapes.
  eg: circle, rect, path
