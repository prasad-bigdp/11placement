How to Link CSS to HTML ?
   There are 3 ways to include css styles  to HTML elements. They are:
   i. inline styling: style can be applied to HTML elements using 'style' as a attribute

   ii. Internal CSS : properties can be applied to HTML elements using 'style' as a element

    <style>
        p /* selector */
        {
            background-color: blue;
            color: white;
        }
    </style>

    iii. External CSS: Combining Internal CSS with HTML will become complex when lines of code. we can use complete styles as a External file with extension .css and link it with HTML using 'link' tag

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="css file path" />


    Basic Selectors:
       we can select elements using tagname, classname or id
       tagname{

       }
       .classname{

       }
       #id
       {

       }
       always id is powerful. preference is !important>#id>.classname>tagname
