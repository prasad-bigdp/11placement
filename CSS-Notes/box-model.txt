Box-Model: In CSS , Every element in a web page is treated as  a Box
  A Box contains
   Border: width style color;
   Border-radius : size of corner radius
   padding : gap between content and the border
   margin: gap outside the border
  
Usually, padding increases height and width of element, To stop these behaviour we can use 
      box-sizing:border-box;

Units:
   units are used to measure the properties
   px - pixel - it is the smallest measure of screen resolution
   % -- it is x percentage of parent properties
   vh -- viewport height -- represents screen height
   vw -- viewport width -- represents screen width
