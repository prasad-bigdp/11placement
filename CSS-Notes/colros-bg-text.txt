Colors: Colors represents Brand. For a good design , we suggest colors to be minimal with 60- 30 - 10 ratio. usually colors are primary(used as main brand color), secondary(used as supplement color), accent(used as links,hovering etc..,).
        colors can be represented as name, hexcode(eg:#c358c0), rgb(125,221,54) combines colors as red,green, blue from 0 to 255 , rgba(125,225,54,0.4) where a is alpha ranging from 0.0 to 1.0 (transparency),  hsl(hue,saturation,lightness) -- hue is 0 to 359deg, saturation is darkness percentage, lightness is light percentage
