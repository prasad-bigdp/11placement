Transition: Transition refers to change from one state to another state
Transitions observe the change with three properties
  Transition-property: lists properties to observe change | all
  Transition-duration: defines the time the transition takes(s or ms)
  Transition-timing-function: defines the way transition changes like
     ease-in  ---- slow to fast
     east-out ---- fast to slow
     ease-in-out --- slow--fast--slow
     ease -- exponential growth
     linear -- constant growth

eg:   #box{
    height:100px;width:100px;background-color:blue;
    transition:all 2s ease;
}
#box:hover{
    transform: translateX(200px)
}


Animations: Animations are nothing but multiple transitions. A transition applies on two states but animations applies on multiple states(called frames)
   i. First we need to create and define Keyframes
   ii. Apply the animation to elements
