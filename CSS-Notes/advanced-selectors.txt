Advanced Selectors: In CSS, we can select an element using multiple ways. basic Selectors are class name, id name and tagname.
Immediate Child Selector: 
      element1>element2
      it selects elements2 which is directly child of element1
Descendant Selector:
      element1 element2
      it selects element2 which is Descendant of element1
Immediate sibling Selector:
      element1+element2
      it selects element2 which comes right after element1
property Selector:
      element2[attrribute="value"]
      it selects element2 which is having specific attribute and value

Pseudo classes: These selectors are used to select specific part of the element. These slectors uses ::
 i. ::first-letter: it is used to select the first letter of text
 ii. ::first-line: it is used to select the first line of text
 iii. ::selection: it is used to select the text when user tried to select
 iv. ::before: it is used to add some content before an element
 v. ::after: it is used to add some content after an element

 Pseudo Elements: These selectors are used to select elements based on state or position of element.These elements uses :
 i. :hover -- it selects element when mouse over the element
 ii. :link  -- it selects all anchor tags which are links
     :active -- it selects anchor tag when user clicked
     :visited -- it selects anchor tag when it is already visited
     :focus  -- it selects input elements when they are focused
 iii. :first-child -- it selects elements which are first child of parent
      :last-child -- it selects elements which are last child of parent
      :nth-child(n) -- it selects elements which are specific numbered
      :nth-last-child(n) -- it selects elements which are in specific position from last

  we can even select elements using :required, :optional,:disabled,:enabled etc..,
